Convert YAPS password file to KeePassX XML
==========================================
I wanted to migrate my YAPS password file from PalmOS 5 Treo 650 to KeepassX
format (http://www.keepassx.org/)

I developed this in Perl5 on Ubuntu 8.04.

You will prolly need to prep your exported YAPS passwords first, refer to the
NOTES section below for hints.

USAGE:

Your YAPS exported file is yaps.txt in the same directory as the program.

./convert.pl

The generated KeePassX XML file is: yaps.xml

NOTES:

1. After exporting my YAPS passwords I noticed yaps.txt had a BOM at start of file (visible in less)

eg.
<U+FEFF>#,AA.com,,username@hotmail.com,corsa,,

By referring to these docs: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=724474

I used the following to get rid of it:
$ perl -CD -pe 'tr/\x{feff}//d'  yaps.txt > yaps-nobom.txt 

Delete empty lines in vim with:
:%s/^\n//

2. The YAPS exported txt file has carriage return and newlines, convert this to UNIX format by installing:

Package: tofrodos
Description: Converts DOS <-> Unix text files, alias tofromdos
 DOS text files traditionally have CR/LF (carriage return/line feed) pairs as
 their new line delimiters while Unix text files traditionally have LFs (line
 feeds) to terminate each line. 

On Ubuntu 8.04 install thus:
aptitude install tofrodos

Then: dos2unix yaps.txt (modifies file in place)
